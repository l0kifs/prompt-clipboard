## Business Requirements (BRD) — "Prompt Clipboard" (Working Title)

1. Product Overview
- Name: Prompt Clipboard (working)
- Goal: A cross-platform lightweight Python GUI utility for storing, organizing, fast searching, and inserting text prompts (and associated metadata) for use with AI agents, chatbots, and generative models. The application accelerates workflows for prompt engineers, AI developers, and content creators.

2. User Pain Points
- Difficult to manage, version, and reuse prompts.
- Loss of prompt context (topic, parameters, results).
- Manual and slow search through prompt collections.
- Security: storing confidential prompts or API keys.
- Seamless insertion of prompts into various applications/terminals/IDEs.

3. Goals and Success Metrics
- Fast save and search: target search/insert time < 300ms for collections up to 50k prompts.
- User satisfaction (NPS) > 40 in the first 6 months.
- Active users: 1k MAU in 6 months (if product is public).
- Zero/minimal risk of secret leakage: encryption for sensitive fields.
- Stability: crash rate < 0.5% during daily use.

4. Target Users
- Prompt engineers
- AI researchers and developers
- Content and marketing specialists
- Power users / DevOps / SRE who use prompts in scripts and automation

5. Market and Positioning
- The tool is oriented toward individual users/teams as a local "vault" for prompts with optional sync capability.
- Competitors: enhanced clipboards (Ditto, Clipy), snippet managers (SnippetsLab), but with a focus on prompts, metadata, and integration with AI agents.

6. Key Features (MVP)
6.1. Storage
- Local database (SQLite with FTS5) for prompts and metadata.
- Record fields: id, title, body (prompt text), tags (array), description, category/folder, created_at, updated_at, language, visibility (private/public), version/variant, parameters (JSON — e.g., temperature, max_tokens), metadata (free-form JSON), encrypted (bool).
- Import/export: JSON/CSV, simple migration.

6.2. Search and Filtering
- Full-text search on title and body (FTS5).
- Filtering by tags, categories, date, language, and parameters.
- Fast incremental search (search-as-you-type).
- Relevance and ranking (TF-IDF/SQLite FTS ranking).

6.3. Insertion and Integrations
- Native "paste" function to target application:
  - Global hotkey to open a mini search window (configurable).
  - "Copy" and "copy with params" buttons (variable substitution in prompt body).
  - "Send to" options: clipboard, active window (OS-native paste shortcut), output to terminal, save to file.
- Templates with placeholder variables and quick value input (prompt templating / mustache-like).
- Copy history (minimal undo/redo mechanism).

6.4. UI/UX
- Cross-platform GUI: Windows/macOS/Linux.
- Two modes: full-size management window and compact "quick search" overlay mini-window.
- Drag-and-drop support for organizing/grouping.
- Record editor with syntax highlighting (code/JSON), result preview (optional).
- Simple tag and folder system.

6.5. Security
- Optional field-level encryption (e.g., body and parameters) with local key (password) and/or OS keystore (Keyring, Keychain, Windows Credential Manager).
- Ability to mark a prompt as "sensitive", requiring confirmation before copying.
- Logs and history are stored locally; the application does not send data to the cloud without explicit permission.

7. Advanced Features (post-MVP)
- Cloud synchronization (optional): end-to-end encryption; support for Git-backed sync, or optional hosted backend.
- Collaboration and sharing with roles/permissions.
- IDE plugin integrations (VSCode, JetBrains) and messengers.
- Built-in prompt versioning (history/diff/restore).
- Public prompt catalog and marketplace.
- Automatic prompt-variation generation (AI-assisted templates).
- Usage analytics (CTR, frequency, success rate based on user results).
- REST/CLI API for automation and CI integration.

8. Non-Functional Requirements
- Cross-platform: support for Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Linux (major distros).
- Performance: UI response < 100ms on local search for sets up to 10k records.
- Reliability: auto-save drafts, atomic transactions when writing to DB.
- Localization: English + ability to add other languages (i18n).
- Accessibility: keyboard-first interface, dark theme support.
- Licensing: MIT / permissive (depends on target strategy).
- Dependencies: minimal set, preference for common and well-maintained libraries.

9. Technical Proposals (Brief)
- Language: Python 3.11+
- GUI framework: choice of option (rationale in separate document):
  - PySide6/PyQt6 — native look, mature, well-suited for desktop.
  - Flet — cross-platform, fast UI, but web-oriented.
  - Tauri + Python backend — more modern stack (Rust+WebView) — more complex.
  - DearPyGui — fast, but fewer standard UI components.
- Storage: SQLite + FTS5; SQLAlchemy or dataset wrapper for simplicity.
- Encryption: libsodium / cryptography; integration with OS keyring (keyring library).
- Packaging: PyInstaller / Briefcase for native builds; provide pip installable CLI for power users.
- Telemetry: only with explicit consent.

10. Data Model (Schema, Minimal)
- prompts table:
  - id (UUID, PK)
  - title (TEXT)
  - body (TEXT)
  - tags (TEXT) — normalized as join or separate tags table
  - category_id (FK) or folder
  - language (TEXT)
  - parameters (JSON)
  - metadata (JSON)
  - version (INTEGER)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - is_sensitive (BOOLEAN)
  - encrypted_blob (BLOB) — if encrypted
- tags table:
  - id, name
- folders table:
  - id, name, parent_id
- audit/history table:
  - id, prompt_id, action, actor, timestamp, diff (JSON)

11. UX Flows (Key Scenarios)
11.1. Creating a Prompt
- User: Open app → Click "New prompt" → Fill title/body/tags/params → Save (auto-version).
- Acceptance: prompt visible in list, searchable immediately.

11.2. Quick Insert (Hotkey)
- User: Press global hotkey → overlay opens → type search query → select prompt → press Enter to copy/paste → overlay closes.
- Acceptance: prompt text placed into clipboard or sent to active window according to user selection within 300ms.

11.3. Using a Template with Variables
- User: Select prompt with placeholders → small form shows variables → fill values → click "Copy with values" → content replaced and copied.
- Acceptance: placeholders replaced correctly and copied.

11.4. Import/Export
- User: File → Import JSON → prompts appear (duplicates handled by uid/title).
- Acceptance: imported items searchable and editable.

12. Security and Compliance
- Secret storage: encrypted fields, keys stored in OS keyring or given to user (password).
- Option to disable clipboard history or auto-copy.
- GDPR compliance: application is local, export provides right to delete data; if sync — provide privacy policy and ability to delete account/data.
- Minimize external calls; use offline-first model.

13. Integrations and API
- CLI: basic commands — add, list, search, export, import, copy.
- REST/Local HTTP API (opt-in) for integration with IDE/agent orchestrators.
- Plugin API (or extension points) for integration with 3rd-party tools.
- Webhooks or web sync (if cloud sync implemented).

14. Acceptance Criteria
- MVP AC1: User can create, edit, tag, and delete a prompt; changes are saved to the local DB.
- MVP AC2: Full-text search returns relevant results for queries on title/body/tags.
- MVP AC3: Global hotkey opens overlay, user can find and copy prompt to clipboard.
- MVP AC4: User can export and import prompt collection to JSON.
- Security AC: User can enable prompt encryption and successfully decrypt them after restarting the app with password input.
- Performance AC: Search over 10k records completes < 300ms on a typical laptop (4-core, SSD).

15. User Stories (Approximate)
- As a Prompt Engineer, I want to quickly find a suitable prompt by keyword to reduce test preparation time.
- As a Developer, I want templates with variables to generate prompts dynamically.
- As a Security-conscious user, I want to encrypt sensitive prompts.

16. Acceptance Tests (High-Level)
- Happy path: Create 50 prompts → search for unique keyword → assert correct result → open and copy prompt via hotkey.
- Edge case A: Import JSON with duplicate titles → expect deduplication prompt.
- Edge case B: Attempt to copy "sensitive" prompt → requires password/confirmation.

17. Roadmap / Release Plan
- Phase 0 (Discovery): specs, wireframes, choose GUI toolkit, prototype hotkey overlay — 2 weeks.
- Phase 1 (MVP): Local storage, CRUD, FTS search, hotkey overlay, import/export, basic encryption — 6–8 weeks.
- Phase 2 (Polish): Themes, keyboard UX, packaging, tests, performance tuning — 2–4 weeks.
- Phase 3 (Optional): Cloud sync, collaboration, plugins — 8–12 weeks.

18. Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: GUI toolkit incompatibilities across OS → Mitigation: choose mature toolkit (PySide6) and provide automated CI builds for each OS.
- Risk: Clipboard interception/security concerns → Mitigation: clear user consent, sensitive-flag, disable history by default.
- Risk: Performance on large datasets → Mitigation: use SQLite FTS, incremental loading, pagination, background indexing.

19. Effort Estimation (Approximate)
- Architecture + prototype: 2 engineer-weeks.
- MVP implementation (single dev): 6–8 engineer-weeks.
- Tests, packaging, cross-platform builds: 2–4 engineer-weeks.
- Total: 10–14 engineer-weeks (MVP).

20. Next Steps (Recommendations)
- Clarify target audience and licensing.
- Choose GUI toolkit and create a prototype overlay with hotkey.
- Thoroughly work out the encryption mechanism and key storage (security review).
- Prepare CI for building cross-platform artifacts.
- Create a backlog: user stories, UI wireframes, API contract.
